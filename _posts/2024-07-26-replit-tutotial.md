## Introduction

In the [previous post](https://devincog.github.io/blogs/programming/2024/07/25/ide-vs-code-editor.html), we learnt about IDEs and Code editors. In this post, we will learn how to setup *Replit* for writing code in python.

## Repltit Introduction
Replit is free online coding workspace that we can use to get started with python with minimal setup.

### Key features

- **Online IDE**: Replit provides an integrated development environment (IDE) that runs directly in our web browser. You don’t need to install anything locally; just visit the Replit website and start coding.
  
- **Python Support**: Replit fully supports Python. We can create Python projects, write Python code, and execute it instantly. It’s a great way to practice Python concepts without worrying about setup.
  
- **Code Editor**: Within Replit, there's a code editor where we write your Python programs. It offers features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and error checking.
  
- **Collaboration**: Replit allows real-time collaboration. You can invite friends or classmates to work on the same project simultaneously. It’s like Google Docs for coding!
  
- **Project Management**: We can organize our Python projects using Replit’s workspace. Create folders, manage files, and keep everything tidy.
  
- **Run Code**: Click the “Run” button, and the Python code executes instantly. You’ll see the output right there in the same window.

- **Learn by Doing**: Replit encourages hands-on learning. Try out Python examples, experiment with code, and see immediate results.

## Python with Replit

Remember our [first python code](https://devincog.github.io/blogs/programming/2024/05/14/Getting-Started-With-Python.html) we wrote? Well, let's see how we cab rewrite it in replit.

- **Step 1**: Go to the [replit website](https://replit.com/) and sign up for an account.
  
    ![replit home page]({{"assets\images\replit-tutorial\replit-home-page.png" | relative_url }})

    ![replit signup page]({{"assets\images\replit-tutorial\replit-signup-page.png" | relative_url }})

- **Step 2**: Create a repl. Select python from the list of templates and Name your file. Then click "Create Repl"
    
    ![replit create file]({{"assets\images\replit-tutorial\replit-create-file.png" | relative_url }})
    ![replit create with name]({{"assets\images\replit-tutorial\replit-createfile-with-name.png" | relative_url }})

- **Step 3**: Now we can write our program we wrote earlier(print("Hello world")) and click run.
    
    ![hello world in python in replit]({{"assets\images\replit-tutorial\hello-world-replit.png" | relative_url }})


## Conclusion

There you go! We have rewritten our helo world pyhon program in replit. Now you can code in any bowser or download the replit app and continue coding anytime.
